# Honour-Splitter
SaaS to split the cost of trips - Java backend and a REACT Native mobile application front end.

Cloud Based Web Applications
● MLO 1. Assess the limitations of static Web solution and design dynamic application
using a variety of industry standard Web application APIs, libraries and technologies to
provide a high quality interactive experience for a target user base
● MLO 2. Deduce the application hosting needs of a client to select a cost effective and
robust application delivery infrastructure using industry standard cloud based
technologies, making informed decisions based upon requirements from a client,
constraints from the environment and skills available of the development team who is
working on a web application
● MLO 3. Review and provide a secure point of entry to existing data storage infrastructure
to newly developed solutions through the use of data transportation and bespoke data
access methods removing the need to depend on older web based technologies for
newly developed application solutions
● MLO 4. Analyse existing web applications needs to migrate the existing application and
infrastructure to a cloud based environment utilising dynamically allocated resources and
services.
● MLO 6. Design cloud based web applications which utilise existing libraries and services
to CCT Validation Submission of Higher Diploma in Science in Computing – 75ECTS
148 provide the maximum user experience with considerations to the maintenance and
testing of the developed solution
Mobile Development
● MLO 3. Implement intelligent user interfaces using the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
design pattern.
● MLO 4. Analyse a given client brief to develop an interactive mobile application that
utilises the device sensors and appropriate storage capabilities while situating the result
in a user-focused design.
Algorithms & Constructs
● MLO 1. Identify and select appropriate algorithms and constructs for a given real-world
problem by differentiating between the complexity, scalability and efficiency of different
candidate solutions.
● MLO 4. Develop and implement custom algorithms and constructs for a wide variety of
application-specific tasks, taking performance and system resources into consideration.
● MLO 5. Employ a variety of different constructs and to implement and categorise
different searching and traversal algorithms over said constructs.
